## Usage

### Prerequisites

- You **must** have the **SplitSecondDC (SSDC)** version of the game
- Join the official community Discord server to get SSDC: [https://discord.gg/GgYQFMM8FH](https://discord.gg/GgYQFMM8FH)

### How to Use

1. Download and extract the latest release (`SS_VCT.zip`)
2. Open `VehCol-Tool.html` in your browser
3. Locate your game's `VehicleColors.params` file:
   - File Location: `[Main Game Folder]\Deferred\Vehicles`
4. **Important**: First-time setup
   - Use the fixed `vehiclecolors.params` from the `fixed-vehiclecolors_for-ssdc` folder
   - Replace your original game file with this fixed version to prevent DLC vehicle conflicts
5. Upload your `VehicleColors.params` file to the tool
6. Customize colors as desired
7. Save the file and replace the original in your game folder

### Steam Version

Currently not directly supported. The Steam version uses packed `.ark` archives. It's strongly recommended to use the SSDC version for full modding support.
